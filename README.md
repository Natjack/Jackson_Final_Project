# Jackson_Final_Project
This project addresses one of my areas of interest and that is cost of care and utilization of services by the dual eligible population at one of Utah's Medicaid providers.  I will define a class and a derived class that inherits from the parent class.  
I will use data permanence using data serialization.
I will have a user interface in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
I will use visualization.
