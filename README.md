# Chronic Condition Cost Project
This purpose of this project is to compare patient chronic condition groupings from a Medicaid health plan which is interested in population care management and Triple Aim: improving population health, improving patient care, and reducting the per capita cost of provideing health care.  These goals can be achieved by looking at patient chronic condition groupings that have the following attributes:  the name of the chronic condtion, the number of members, overall cost per member, drug and medical cost per member, admissions, ED visits, and total cost.  Determining the cost of treating particular chronic condition populations and what drives the cost (the attributes) can help a health plan achieve the Triple Aim.  This project uses chronic conditions, age groups, ED visits, total cost as the starting point for comparing chronic conditon costs.  The visual shows chronic condtion groupings whose total costs are greater than $200,000.00.

The project can be used to compare chronic conditions by total cost, drug cost, medical cost, ED visits, admissions, EBM complicance, number of members.  The project can also be used to compare by age group:  50-64, 65-84, over 85.
